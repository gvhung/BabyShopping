        We love what we do, and how we do it.</h2>
    <p>
        We work with natural materials and search the world for the softest fabrics we can
        find. We choose our production partners with great care and take our decisions on
        the design, colors, safety, and perfect fit rather seriously.

        When we say soft, we mean soft.</h2>
    <p>
        Our sleep sacks are made with 100% organically grown Pima cotton. The Pima cotton
        was chosen for is exceptional softness and high quality. It only takes one touch
        to feel how luxuriously soft organic Pima cotton can be.

    <p>
        At Hush Pure Sleep, we believe that being socially and environmentally responsible
        is the only way forward in the world we live in today. That is why we aim to work
        with reputable sustainable production partners in the cotton and sowing industry,
        and try to limit the impact of our business on the environment as much as possible.
        Where possible we have our products manufactured in the region where are products
        are sold.

    <h2>
        We are pure.</h2>
    <p>
        Organic cotton is farmed without the use of pesticides. By buying organic cotton,
        Hush Pure Sleep supports organic farmers’ efforts to make a difference. Organic
        cotton is also better for your children’s sensitive skin. That is why Hush Pure
        Sleep wants the cotton to be as pure as possible.
